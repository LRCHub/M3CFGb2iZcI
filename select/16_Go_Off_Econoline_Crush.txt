Me And All My Friends Here We Go
Here We Go
We Like It Slamming Out The Stereo
Stereo
We Want To Make It
Want To Make It Go
We Want To Make It
Make It
Make It Go Off

I Like The Want In It
The Truth In It
The Eagerness
It's No Lie
I Like The Hurt Of It
The Hate Of It
The Pain
The Beauty In The Fight

What Are You Fighting For?
It's All So Unbelievable
You Think It's All For You

I Can Feel It
I Can Fell It In The Rythm Go
I Can Feel It
I Can Feel It Off The Stereo
It Takes Me Where
Where I Want To Go
It Makes Me
Makes Me Go Off
It Makes Me Makes Me
Makes Me Go Off
I Want The Need Of it
The Greed Of It
The Bleed Of It
It's No Lie
I See The Whole Of It
The Cold Of It
The Wanting
The Burning Of Desire
